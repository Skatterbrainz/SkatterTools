<h1>SkatterTools License Mumbo-Jumbo</h1>

<p>Blah Blah Blah</p>

<p>Yap Yap Yap</p>

<p>I only ask that you respect a few basic requests:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Respect the MIT license under which this flying garbage can is provided to you.</li>
    <li>You may (and hopefuly will) contribute improvements to this project via the GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Any derivative uses of this mess will include some clear indication where it came from.</li>
    <li>You will respect coffee, in all forms, hot or cold.  Coffee is the source of all intelligent life.</li>
</ul>

<p>The full license is available online at <a href="https://github.com/Skatterbrainz/SkatterTools/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_new">https://github.com/Skatterbrainz/SkatterTools/blob/master/LICENSE</a></p>

<p>If you're too cheap to afford an Internet connection, or you live in a place where they kill people
who try to access the Internet, I've included the MIT license agreement below.  Please be safe out there!</p>
