* A portable web console for viewing and managing AD and CM features
* Built from PowerShell to run on PoSH Server (http://www.poshserver.net)
  * (similar capability to how Microsoft Windows Admin Center works / local web app)
* Open-source, Fully-Customizable
* THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - Enjoy!
